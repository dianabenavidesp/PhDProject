Overview
========

HRSVM is a method for hypothesis refinement using knowledge transfer. This software accompanies the paper: Benavides-Prado, D., Koh, Y. S., and Riddle, P. (2020). Towards Knowledgeable Supervised Lifelong Learning Systems. Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research (JAIR), 68, 159-224. 

Our implementation is built on top of LibSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011) and AccGenSVM (Benavides-Prado et al., 2017).

Software usage
==============

In order to use AccGenSVM, consider the parameters: 

| key | name                   | description                                                                          |
|:----|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -M  | maximum\_sources       | maximum number of source hypotheses that will be transferred from                    |
| -N  | number\_features       | number of features                    												  |
| -F  | number\_features       | features selected by FNN (if not selected, list all features from 1 to d)            |
| -K  | kl\_threshold          | KL-divergence threshold from 0 to 1 (inclusive)                                      |
| -B  | balance\_factor        | contribution of the source hypotheses (set a number between 0 and 1 inclusive)       |
| -f  | training\_examples     | name of the file containing the target training examples                             |
| -H  | source\_hypothesis     | name of the (.model) file containing a source hypothesis                             |
|                              | each source should be listed using "-H source_hypothesis"                            |
| -y  | output\_model          | output (.model) file                                                                 |
| -a  | output\_log            | output log file (optional)                                                           |


Alternatively, see the AccGenSVM software (available at: https://github.com/nanarosebp/PhDProject/tree/master/AccGenSVM). 

To use HRSVM, consider the parameters required for a regular \nu-SVM (except \nu, which will be set automatically to the maximal feasible value (Chen et al., 2005), and add:

| key | name                   | description                                                                          |
|:----|:-----------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| -H  | model\_to\_refine      | name of the (.model) file containing the SVM model to be refined                     |
| -S  | source\_model          | name of the (.model) file containing the source SVM to transfer from                 |
|     | 			           | (this parameter can be used multiple times in case of several source SVM)            |
| -M  | refined\_model         | name of the (.model) file that will contain the refined version of the SVM model     |
| -G  | gamma\_value           | gamma in Eq. 22 and Eq. 24 of the paper                    						  |
| -L  | transfer\_log          | name of the transfer (output) final log file generated by AccGenSVM                  |

Executable and source code
==========================

Download the .jar executable file for HRSVM (hrsvm.jar) and AccGenSVM (accgensvm.jar). 

First, run AccGenSVM with your selected parameters. Two files, named transfer_log.txt and transfer_log_final.txt will be generated as a result of transferring forward selectively, in the same directory where you run AccGenSVM. You will need transfer_log_final.txt for using HRSVM. 

Then run HRSVM.jar with your selected parameters. 

If you want to obtain/use/modify the source code, download the hrsvm directory.

The directory data_scripts contains the scripts to extract the samples used in the experiments.

The directory other_methods_scripts contains the scripts used for the counterpart methods ELLA and CL.
